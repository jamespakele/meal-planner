# ðŸ§ª Meal Planning SaaS â€” Lean MVP Product Requirements Document (PRD)

---

## Executive Summary

This project is a group-based meal planning web application that automates weekly meal suggestion collection, enables collaborative decision-making through two distinct shared links, and generates organized shopping lists. It is designed for household managers to coordinate meals without modeling individual members. Serving calculations scale based on demographic counts for adults, teens, kids, and toddlers. The system ensures the right ingredients are available, in the right quantities, at the right time.

---

## Development Methodology

The application will be developed using a **modular, component-based approach**, building each piece in a logical sequence that supports iterative delivery. Development will follow **test-first principles**, with **unit tests written before any component logic**.  

All code will be written in **TypeScript**, using Supabaseâ€™s auto-generated types, and will follow modern best practices for modularity, maintainability, scalability, and security.

## Goals

- Enable group meal planning without tracking individual member accounts
- Scale ingredient quantities based on demographic counts and weights
- Provide two link types per plan for collaborative decision-making
- Notify the manager of any form submission
- Allow plan adjustments with instant serving recalculation
- Generate categorized shopping lists from finalized plans
- Allow managers to star meals for future reuse

---

## Non-Goals

- Individual user accounts for participants
- Multiple group memberships for a single user
- Pantry inventory tracking
- Grocery service API integration
- Calendar-based scheduling or drag-and-drop planning
- Offline form completion or draft saving

---

## Process Flow

### Step 1 â€” Meal Options Generation
- Trigger: Manager starts a new weekly plan
- Input: Group demographics and dietary restrictions
- Process: AI generates N meal options with scaled ingredients
- Output: Meals stored in `Meal` table

### Step 2 â€” Dual FormLink Creation
- Trigger: Meals are ready for a plan
- Process: Create `Plan` record and two `FormLink` records:
  - Coâ€‘manager link (authoritative)
  - Other participant link (advisory)
- Output: Two unique, public URLs with roles stored in Supabase

### Step 3 â€” Meal Selection Phase
- Input: Participant opens a FormLink
- Process:
  - Loads available meals
  - Captures selections
  - Stores `FormResponse` with associated role
- Conflict Rule: Coâ€‘manager overrides conflicting participant choices

### Step 4 â€” Plan Finalization
- Trigger: Manager reviews submissions
- Process:
  - Apply conflict resolution
  - Save final selections to `PlanMeal`
  - Trigger ingredient scaling RPC

### Step 5 â€” Shopping List Generation
- Trigger: Plan finalized
- Process:
  - Aggregate ingredients from chosen meals
  - Apply AE scaling factor
  - Categorize and deduplicate
- Output: Stored in `ShoppingList` table

## Target Users

**Household Manager**
- Creates groups and defines demographics
- Shares form links
- Finalizes plans
- Stars meals for reuse

**Household Participants**
- Receive a link and submit meal preferences anonymously

---

## User Stories

- As a manager, I can create a group with demographic counts and dietary restrictions
- As a manager, I can generate two shareable form links for each plan
- As a participant, I can submit preferences without logging in
- As a manager, I can finalize a plan applying coâ€‘manager overrides
- As a manager, I can generate a categorized shopping list
- As a manager, I can mark meals as starred for reuse

---

- Associate responses with the originating link and role
- Apply override rules in finalization

### Plan Finalization
- Review submissions

## Serving Calculation

| Demographic | AE Weight |
|-------------|-----------|
| Adult       | 1.0       |
| Teen        | 1.2       |
| Kid         | 0.7       |
| Toddler     | 0.4       |

**Formula:**  
`AE = (Adults Ã— 1.0) + (Teens Ã— 1.2) + (Kids Ã— 0.7) + (Toddlers Ã— 0.4)`

---

## Data Model

**Group:** id, name, adults, teens, kids, toddlers, dietary_restrictions[], status  
**Seasonality:** ingredient_name, start_month, end_month, region  
**Meal:** id, title, description, prep_time, steps[], ingredients[], tags[], starred  
**Plan:** id, week_start, group_ids[], status  
**PlanMeal:** id, plan_id, meal_id, day, notes  
**FormLink:** id, plan_id, public_token, role  
**FormResponse:** id, form_link_id, form_link_role, submitted_at, selections[], comments  
**ShoppingList:** id, plan_id, items[]

---

## API Example

`POST /api/forms`  
```json
{
  "plan_id": "plan_456"
}
```

**Response:**  
```json
{
  "links": [
    {"role": "co_manager", "url": "https://app/f/cm123"},

  ]
}
```
