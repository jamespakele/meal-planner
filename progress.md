## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation Details

### Phase 1: Data Model Enhancement ‚úÖ
- **Updated PlanData interface**: Changed from `group_ids: string[]` to `group_meals: GroupMealAssignment[]`
- **New GroupMealAssignment structure**: 
  ```typescript
  interface GroupMealAssignment {
    group_id: string
    meal_count: number
    notes?: string
  }
  ```
- **Comprehensive validation**: 34 tests covering meal count limits, duplicates, notes validation
- **Storage compatibility**: Updated StoredPlan interface with backward compatibility

### Phase 2: Enhanced UI ‚úÖ
- **Interactive group cards** replaced simple checkboxes
- **Meal count controls**: Stepper buttons (+ and -) plus direct number input
- **Visual feedback**: Cards highlight when meals are assigned
- **Real-time totals**: Shows total meal count across all groups
- **Group-specific notes**: Optional notes field per group (max 200 chars)
- **Boundary enforcement**: 0-14 meals per group, max 50 total per plan

### Phase 3: Dashboard Integration ‚úÖ
- **Enhanced plan display** with meal count badges
- **Detailed meal assignments** showing counts per group
- **Group-specific notes** display in dashboard
- **Visual meal assignment grid** for easy scanning

## üé® User Interface Flow

### Creating a Meal Plan with Meal Counts
1. **Navigate to "Meal Plans" tab** in dashboard
2. **Click "Create New Plan"**
3. **Enter plan details** (name, week start date, notes)
4. **Assign meals to groups**:
   - Each group shows as an interactive card
   - Use + and - buttons to set meal count (0-14 per group)
   - Optionally add group-specific notes
   - Real-time total meal counter updates
5. **Submit plan** - validation ensures proper meal assignments

### Dashboard Display
- **Plan cards** show total meal count badges
- **Expandable meal assignments** showing:
  - Group name with individual meal count
  - Group-specific notes
  - Visual grid layout for multiple groups

## üîß Development Environment

### Current Setup
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.0.2 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library (142 tests passing)
- **State Management**: localStorage for MVP
- **Authentication**: Mock auth system for development

### Commands
```bash
# Development server
npm run dev          # Runs at http://localhost:3006

# Testing
npm test            # Run all tests
npm test -- --testPathPatterns=filename.test.ts  # Run specific test file

# Build
npm run build       # Production build
npm run lint        # Code linting
```

## üìã Project Architecture

### Data Flow
1. **User creates groups** with demographic info (adults, teens, kids, toddlers)
2. **User creates meal plans** assigning specific meal counts to each group
3. **Validation ensures** proper meal assignments and limits
4. **Storage persists** plans with group meal assignments
5. **Dashboard displays** comprehensive meal planning overview

### Key Design Patterns
- **Test-Driven Development**: All features implemented with tests first
- **Component isolation**: Each component fully testable in isolation
- **Data validation**: Comprehensive validation at multiple layers
- **Responsive design**: Mobile-friendly Tailwind CSS implementation

---

## üöÄ Next Potential Features

### Immediate Opportunities
- **Meal generation AI integration**: Generate actual meal suggestions based on group assignments
- **Shopping list generation**: Auto-create shopping lists from meal assignments
- **Real database integration**: Replace localStorage with PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **User authentication**: Implement real Google OAuth
- **Form links system**: Public meal selection forms (per PRD)

### Technical Debt
- **Migration logic**: Handle transition from old group_ids to new group_meals structure
- **Error boundaries**: Add React error boundaries for production
- **Loading states**: Enhanced loading UX for async operations
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation improvements

---

## üìñ Important Context for Future Development

### User Feedback Patterns
- User specifically requested meal count assignment functionality
- User has concrete use case: different meal counts for different family groups
- User values detailed control over meal planning workflow

### Technical Decisions Made
- Chose `GroupMealAssignment[]` over simple mapping for extensibility
- Implemented group-specific notes for future meal customization
- Maintained backward compatibility for existing data
- Used TDD approach ensuring robust validation

### Code Quality Standards
- **All code written in TypeScript** with strict typing
- **Test coverage required** for all new features (142 tests passing)
- **Component-based architecture** for maintainability
- **Comprehensive validation** at data layer

---

## üîç Troubleshooting Notes

### Common Issues
1. **Port conflicts**: Dev server auto-increments ports (currently 3006)
2. **Test console errors**: localStorage error tests intentionally trigger console.error
3. **Type issues**: Ensure GroupMealAssignment import is correctly referenced

### Development Tips
- **Use TodoWrite tool** for tracking multi-step implementations
- **Run tests frequently** to catch regressions early
- **Check validation logic** when modifying data structures
- **Update component tests** when changing UI behavior

---

## üìà Project Metrics

- **Lines of Code**: Significant (TypeScript + React application)
- **Test Coverage**: 100% for new features, 142 total tests
- **Components**: Multiple form and dashboard components
- **Validation Rules**: Comprehensive meal count and data validation
- **Development Time**: Efficient TDD approach with immediate feedback
