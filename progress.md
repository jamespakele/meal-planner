## 🔍 Troubleshooting Notes & Project Quirks

### Common Issues & Fixes That Work
1. **Port conflicts**: Dev server auto-increments ports (3000→3001→...→3007)
2. **Test console errors**: localStorage error tests intentionally trigger console.error (expected)
3. **TypeScript filter issues**: Use explicit forEach loop instead of filter with type guards
   ```typescript
   // Don't do: meals.filter((meal): meal is ValidMeal => validate(meal))  
   // Do: const valid = []; meals.forEach(meal => { if (validate(meal)) valid.push(meal) })
   ```
4. **ESLint unescaped quotes**: Use `&ldquo;` and `&rdquo;` instead of `"` in JSX
5. **Build failures with test files**: Jest types in testUtils.tsx cause production build issues

### React Hook Patterns That Cause Issues
1. **useEffect with missing dependencies**: Always add function dependencies or use useCallback
2. **Infinite render loops**: Be careful with object/array dependencies in useEffect
3. **Complex state management**: Multi-step forms (like PlanForm) need careful state isolation

### Import Patterns That Work
- **Always import types explicitly**: `import type { Interface } from './file'`
- **Avoid circular dependencies**: Components should import from libs, not other components
- **Mock providers need exported types**: Export interfaces from MockAuthProvider for tests

### Development Environment Quirks
1. **Next.js cache issues**: Delete `.next` folder if strange compilation errors
2. **TypeScript strict mode**: Project uses strict TypeScript - all types must be defined
3. **Tailwind CSS**: Uses custom utility classes, check existing components for patterns
4. **localStorage in SSR**: Always check `typeof window === 'undefined'` for localStorage calls

### Testing Patterns That Work
1. **TDD approach**: Write tests first, then implementation - prevents many bugs
2. **Mock external dependencies**: Always mock localStorage, API calls, etc.
3. **Test isolation**: Each test should be independent and clean up after itself
4. **Component testing**: Test user interactions, not implementation details

### Component Architecture Learnings
1. **Form components**: PlanForm pattern with multi-step state management works well
2. **Progress components**: Separate progress hooks from UI components for reusability  
3. **Selection interfaces**: Group-based organization with bulk operations is user-friendly
4. **Error boundaries**: Need to add React error boundaries for production stability

### Development Tips
- **Use TodoWrite tool** for tracking multi-step implementations
- **Run tests frequently** to catch regressions early
- **Check validation logic** when modifying data structures
- **Update component tests** when changing UI behavior
- **Isolate complex components** for easier debugging
- **Use React.memo** for expensive render operations
